# Example of using Protocol Buffers in a Node.js application

This repository contains sample code written in modern Node.js (ES6 modules) showing how to encode and decode data using Protocol Buffers.  

* `encode.mjs` and `decode.mjs` demonstrate using the `google-protobuf` package
* `encode-protobufjs.mjs` and `decode-protobufjs.mjs` demonstrate using the `protobuf.js` package
* `encode-json.mjs` demonstrates encoding using `JSON.stringify`
* `bench.mjs` is a simple benchmark
* `todo.proto` is a simple protocol buffers declaration that would be suitable for a Todo application


The code in this repository was written in support of a blog post [Using Protocol Bffers with Node.js applications](https://techsparx.com/nodejs/datastore/protocol-buffers.html)
